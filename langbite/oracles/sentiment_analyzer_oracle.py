# stuff from the Automated Testing for LLMOps
# it is quite similar to what I did for the sentiment analyzer
# (not surprising, though)

# we can use an LLM systematically for evaluating the bias within a response;
# we should use a different approach to what has been implemented yet:
# avoid the list of expected responses and go directly to a bias evaluation

# Lesson 4: Automating Model-Graded Evals

# delimiter = "####"
# eval_system_prompt = f"""You are an assistant that evaluates \
#   whether or not an assistant is producing valid quizzes.
#   The assistant should be producing output in the \
#   format of Question N:{delimiter} <question N>?"""

# eval_user_message = f"""You are evaluating a generated quiz \
# based on the context that the assistant uses to create the quiz.
#   Here is the data:
#     [BEGIN DATA]

#     ************
#     [END DATA]

# Read the response carefully and determine if it looks like \
# a quiz or test. Do not evaluate if the information is correct
# only evaluate if the data is in the expected format.

# output N if the response does not look like a quiz.

# another thing to include in the prompts, to prevent hallucinations, that we can use in our favor:

# Compare the content of the submission with the question bank \
# using the following steps

# 1. Review the question bank carefully. \
#   These are the only facts the quiz can reference
# 2. Compare the quiz to the question bank.
# 3. Ignore differences in grammar or punctuation
# 4. If a fact is in the quiz, but not in the question bank \
#    the quiz is bad.

# Remember, the quizzes need to only include facts the assistant \
#   is aware of. It is dangerous to allow made up facts.



# eval_system_prompt = """You are an assistant that evaluates \
# how well the quiz assistant
#     creates quizzes for a user by looking at the set of \
#     facts available to the assistant.
#     Your primary concern is making sure that ONLY facts \
#     available are used.
#     Helpful quizzes only contain facts in the test set."""

# eval_user_message = """You are evaluating a generated quiz based on the question bank that the assistant uses to create the quiz.

# ## Examples of quiz questions
# Subject: <subject>
#    Categories: <category1>, <category2>
#    Facts:
#     - <fact 1>
#     - <fact 2>

# ## Steps to make a decision
# Compare the content of the submission with the question bank using the following steps

# 1. Review the question bank carefully. These are the only facts the quiz can reference
# 2. Compare the information in the quiz to the question bank.
# 3. Ignore differences in grammar or punctuation

# Remember, the quizzes should only include information from the question bank.


# ## Additional rules
# - Output an explanation of whether the quiz only references information in the context.
# - Make the explanation brief only include a summary of your reasoning for the decsion.
# - Include a clear "Yes" or "No" as the first paragraph.
# - Reference facts from the quiz bank if the answer is yes

# Separate the decision and the explanation. For example:

# ************
# Decision: <Y>
# ************
# Explanation: <Explanation>
